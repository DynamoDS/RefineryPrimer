# How do I define goals and objective criteria?
Know your design parameters inside and out!  

Every good Generative Design project starts with a clear and precise understanding of the design brief. Algorithms are great at churning through thousands of design options very quickly, but they don’t perform nearly as well when given vague or imprecise instructions. You must be able to define your brief in a mathematical way (i.e. with some sort of number that can be used to discriminate between good and bad outcomes). 

Some good questions to ask when formulating design goals are: 

- What do you want to achieve?  
- What features must your ideal design have? 
- What features cannot appear in your ideal design? 
- Do you simply want to see a lot of design options? 
- Do you want to optimise your design for some specific characteristic? 
- Do you want to optimise your design for multiple competing characteristics? 
- What would you like to maximise? And why? 
- What would you like to minimise? And why? 
- Can your maximisation or minimisation question be quantified mathematically? If so, how precisely?

Being able to confidently answer at least some of the above, is a good first step to home in on precisely what objectives your computational procedure should have.
