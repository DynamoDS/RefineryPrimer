# What Is Optimization?

<img src="../../assets/deeper/whatisoptimization.png" style="width:200px;"/>

Optimization is an inherently mathematical subject. It is about maximizing or minimizing some mathematical function to arrive at the best possible solution to a problem, and involves creating design options that are shaped by certain outcomes as they are being created.

Optimization problems arise in all kinds of fields, from aerospace engineering to architectural design. However, regardless of domain, every optimization problem has three features:

1. An objective function. 
2. Constraints.
3. Data.
