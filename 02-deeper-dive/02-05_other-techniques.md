# Other Techniques

![](../.gitbook/assets/othertechniques.png)

There are many techniques that can be used to tackle a Computational Design problem.

In addition to the genetic algorithm, other examples include:

* solving with pen and paper 
* manual guess and check 
* set packing or partitioning algorithms 
* gradient descent  
* Stochastic \(or, random\) Local Search and filtering results to find a desired maximum, minimum, or median values.
* Linear, Integer, or Quadratic programming  

Some of these techniques are quite basic and easy to implement \(see the '[Optioneering section](02-02_optioneering.md)'\); others are far more sophisticated. Choosing the right technique for your application is tricky and much more of an art than a science. Often, it comes down to the precise design question you are tackling and your familiarity with a given technique.
