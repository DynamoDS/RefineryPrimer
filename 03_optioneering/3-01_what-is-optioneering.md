# What is Optioneering?

Optioneering is the human touch in the computational process, it is the name given to the task of selecting from the many design variants outputted by a Generative Design procedure. Optioneering is not a computational process, rather the designer sifts through a series of design variants, tags ones she likes or identifies options that are particularly aligned with her design objectives. It is a great way to add in all those little elements of a brief that an algorithm may not be able to capture; optioneering brings a designer’s feel and eye into the equation. 

Consider the table example in [Section 1-05](#product-design). In the optioneering stage, a designer will browse through her set of designs and select those she likes most. Perhaps her selections are particularly eye-catching, perhaps they are ultra-lightweight and practical. Whatever the reason, she selects and sorts her most favoured options. She continues narrowing down her selections till she’s left with just a few. She then mixes and matches between these options – perhaps one table’s legs aren’t sturdy enough and should be swapped with those of another table that is just too narrow – until she finally gets to her final design. It’s this picking and choosing and mixing and matching that is the essence of optioneering. It helps a user find the best design of the bunch.
