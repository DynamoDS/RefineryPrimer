# Setting up a Graph for Refinery

## Inputs

To set up a Dynamo graph for Refinery right-click on each node used to drive the graph and ensure that the _`Is Input`_ option is ticked. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as _`IN_description`_ will help to distinguish these inputs in Refinery.

\(Note: currently all inputs must be number slider nodes\)

## Outputs

To define outputs in Refinery, right-click on the watch nodes and select the _`Is Output`_ option. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as _`OUT_description`_ will help to distinguish these outputs in Refinery.

\(Note: currently all outputs must be watch nodes with a data type of Number\).

Refinery would proceed to create a copy of your graph and would be available to launch. Remember that graphs that have the same name would be overwritten.
