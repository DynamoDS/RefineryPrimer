# Installing the Refinery Toolkit from the Dynamo Package Manager

Now that we're familiar with what generative design is, the basic concepts behind it and have seen some example use-cases, the next question becomes:

> how can we leverage Refinery to apply generative design principles to real-world design problems?

This chapter demonstrates the answer to this question through a series of common design challenges.

It's important to note that although it sounds complex, a generative design approach is not limited to only solving complex design problems. In fact, once a designer has a computational design process set up, generative design can help solve design questions with ease and eliminate huge amounts of manual work from both easy and complex design problems alike.
