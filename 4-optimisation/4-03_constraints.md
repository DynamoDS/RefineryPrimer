# Constraints 
A constraint is a condition that a solution of an optimisation problem must satisfy. In the table example, constraints may include the following: 

- The table must have four legs 
- The table must be at least 50 centimetres wide 
- The table may be no more than 1 metre tall 
- The table cannot be blue 

Constraints give a model its realism; they confine the solution to only take realistic values or values that the user knows are critical to the design brief. If a model is unconstrained, it is likely to return absurd and unrealistic results that aren’t of any practical use (a circular table that is three metres high with a single leg that balances on a point, for instance). Constraints are vital as they ensure that a generative design algorithm outputs something realistic and reasonable.
