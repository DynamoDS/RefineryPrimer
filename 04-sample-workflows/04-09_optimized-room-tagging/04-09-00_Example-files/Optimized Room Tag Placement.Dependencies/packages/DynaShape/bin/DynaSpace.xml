If the adjacency requirement is fully satisfied, the two bubbles should touch each other and hence the error will be 0. If the two bubbles are too far apart, the error will become positive. If the bubbles are too close (in which case they overlap), the error will become negative.</returns>
            <returns name="spaceAdjErrorRatios">Similar to space adjacency errors, but measured as fractions rather than distance values. It is defined as "D / (R1 + R2"), where R1 and R2 are the bubbles' radii and D is the distance between the two bubbles' centers. We want the error ratio to be as close to 1.0 as possible. Error larger than 1.0 means the bubbles are too far apart and error smaller than 1.0 means the bubbles are too close and overlapping with each other</returns>

            <param name="iterations">The number of iterations that the solver will execute in the background before display the intermediate result. If set to 0 (the default value), the solver will attempt run as many iterations as possible within approximately 25 milliseconds, which is sufficient for real-time visual feedback. Using a small value (e.g. 1) will make the solver appears to run more slowly and display more intermediate result, allowing us to better observe and understand how the nodes and goals behave.</param>
            <param name="boundaryStrength">Control the degree to which the space bubbles should respect the site boundary and not cross over it (Note: in this early DynaSpace version, the boundary polygon MUST be a convex polygon).</param>
            <param name="planarConstraintStrength">Control the degree to which the space bubbles stick the 2D plane horizontal plane. If this value is set to 0 or too low, the space bubbles will deviate from the 2D plane and start floating in 3D space, which is of course will look weird. However, initially setting this value to 0 and slowing increase it might give a better result.</param>
            <param name="sphereCollisionStrength">Control the degree to which the space bubbles do not overlap with each other.</param>
