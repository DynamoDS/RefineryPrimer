# The Role of a Generative Designer

The generative designer is someone in charge of using / maintaining / exploring practical applications for  generative design in an intended work environment. The role can involve one or more people, so it is important to define responsibilities correctly. Some of the possible responsibilities would be described below:

### Identifying the Possible Problems:

Although identifying a possible problem for Generative Design may seem like a straightforward task, making sure that the problem contains certain characteristics that are worth solving may cause this responsibility to become more complex. Some of the criteria that should be considered include: making sure the problem is relevant to the scale of your office; framing problems so they can be reused in different contexts; making sure the complexity of the problem is manageable by your generative design team.

### Workflow Creation

Workflow creation deals with the nuts and bolts of Generative Design. This role would be responsible for creating the actual workflow and relations for variables, results and evaluation criteria. A person who would ideally take this role should be prolific in Dynamo and visual programming; as much of his/her time would be spent in developing workflows within this platform.

### Evaluation

This should desirably be someone external to the generative design process. Someone who is aware of the company/office needs that will allow him/her to be more objective in evaluating how useful and relevant the generative design workflows were and how time-effective they were.
