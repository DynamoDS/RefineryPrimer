# How to Convince Senior Stakeholders of Using Generative Design

One of the main goals of Generative Design for Revit is to make generative design \(as a process\) more accessible and functional to all people within the AEC industry. 

Because of this, it's important that the benefits of using Generative Design can be clearly communicated to people who are less familiar with it.

## Convincing Seniors/Stakeholders

If you are clear that Generative Design for Revit can improve performance in your office and confident that with generative design you'll be able to explore a wider design spectrum than through traditional methods, you may need to figure out how to communicate these advantages to someone who hasn't used it or who has little interest in understanding its capabilities.

Below are some tips that may help you talk to senior stakeholders and people outside of the AEC technology spectrum to use or invest in generative design.

### Focus on Practical Issues Local to Your Practice

Instead of focusing on the all the potential benefits generative design can offer, start by thinking of day-to-day concerns it may be able to help you with. Think about what is stopping your team from being more productive and ask if generative design can help you solve it.

### Start with Easy Problems

Start with small, easy problems before tackling bigger, more complex problems. 

Try to break complex problems into simpler, more generic problems so that the time that you spend on workflows can be re-used later.

### Make Reasonable Time Frames for Solving a Problem

Every problem you intend to solve should have an estimated time-frame and cost defined. This will make it easier to evaluate which problems are worth tackling initially and which problems will have the highest return on investment \(ROI\).

### Don't Oversell It

As mentioned in the section '[What Can't Generative Design Be Used for?](05-02_what-generative-design-cant-be-used-for.md)', it is important to manage expectations when it comes to talking about generative design's capabilities to ensure that people have a clear understanding of what it is for and how it can help.
