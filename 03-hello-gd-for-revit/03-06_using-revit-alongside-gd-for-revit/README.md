# Using Revit Alongside Generative Design

There are many ways to integrate the Generative Design process with current workflows. One key method is to use it to analyse current or create new Revit geometrical and non-geometrical data.

In this chapter, we’ll look at:

* [Using Data from Revit](03-06-01_using-data-from-revit.md)
* [Data.Remember Node Inputs](03-06-02_data-remember-node-inputs.md)
* [How to Test Revit Data Capture](03-06-03_data-capture.md)
* [A Detailed Example Workflow](03-06-04_detailed-example-workflow.md)
* [Sharing Logic and Results](03-06-05_sharing-logic-and-results.md)
* [Current Limitations](03-06-06_current-limitations.md)
* [Accessing Generative Design Directly from Revit](03-06-07_accesing-refinery-directly-from-revit.md)

First, let's look at why we would want to combine Revit and Generative Design processes.
