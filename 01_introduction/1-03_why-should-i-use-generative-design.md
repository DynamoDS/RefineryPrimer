# Why should I use Generative Design?

In a nutshell, generative design is a goal-driven approach to design that uses automation so that designers and engineers
* have better insight into their designs
* can make faster & more informed design decisions 
* can explore more options using the power of computers


### Better outcomes & insight
As the designer, you specify what outcomes you want to achieve for your design and how they are measured. With your guidance, the computer produces sets of optimal designs, along with the data to prove which design performs best against your goals. Analysing how the generated designs measure up against the set goals, a designer can gain valuable insight into which design aspects impact the outcome & how.

### Faster
Generative design can help a designer find “better” designs for his or her project faster, by leveraging what machines are good at: computation & repetition. Computers can generate and evaluate a huge number of design variants in only a fraction of the time it would take an individual designer, allowing us to learn what works & what doesn't at an accelerated pace.

### More variation
Your initial design parameters are used to generate many, even thousands, of potential design solutions, with the only limitation being how fast your computer (or cloud) is.

For example, it's feasible for a designer to explore ten variants or a few tens if using established computational design techniques. It is not uncommon however for an algorithm, once created, to generate thousands of variants in mere minutes.

### Collaborative
An important point to note is that the aim of a generative approach is to augment human capability with computer power, not to replace designers.

To help illustrate this, a generative design process will rarely generate a single output, it will almost always generate a wide range of outputs from which the designer can choose. That is, it doesn’t choose for the user, instead it gives you a list of options to choose from, with the added benefit that they have already been objectively assessed and ranked.
