# Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo

Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo is Autodesk’s latest application for generative design workflows that allows users to explore, evaluate and optimize their Dynamo designs. 

Generative Design allows users to set multiple \(and sometimes competing\) design goals, generate a series of solutions and make decisions by automating the creation and evaluation of designs.

The key benefit of Generative Design are that it makes it easier to optimize a design, as it handles all the back-end work of generation and iteration, presenting the user with either a single design solution or a collection of optimal solutions that best align with his or her goals. 

Generative Design for Revit also allows someone who is not Dynamo-savvy to use generative design workflows.

In short, Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo enables users to tackle the _`Generate`_, _`Evaluate`_, _`Evolve`_ and _`Explore`_ stages of a generative design process.

As a technical note, Generative Design works in the following ways:

* It allows a user to leverage Dynamo Package Manager and run custom nodes \(including Python nodes\).
* It runs locally on a user’s computer. 
* It can be accessed from Dynamo for Revit or Dynamo Sandbox.
* It includes a node to cache Revit or other external data without the need to rely on external processes that could be computationally expensive.

Generative Design is currently available in Revit 2021.
