# What is Computational Design?

**Computational design** is not any one algorithm or off-the-shelf process you can apply. Rather, we describe it as an approach whereby a ****designer defines a series of **instructions, rules,** and **relationships** that precisely identify the steps necessary to achieve a proposed design and the resulting data or geometry. Crucially, these steps must be computable, meaning they can be **understood & calculated by a machine**.

Put simply, computers are very good at **performing calculations** and **executing pre-defined steps.** 

When approaching a design computationally, the procedure used to create the design is the output of a designer’s work, not the resulting object itself. As such, the process of iterating project geometry and data are offloaded to a machine, saving time, money, and effort, and letting the designer focus on the creativity of the design process.
