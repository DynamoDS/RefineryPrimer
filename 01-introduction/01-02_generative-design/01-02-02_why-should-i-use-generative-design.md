# Why Should I Use Generative Design?

In a nutshell, generative design is a goal-driven approach to design that uses automation so that designers and engineers

* have better insight into their designs
* can make faster & more informed design decisions 
* can explore more options using the power of computers

## Better outcomes & insight

As the designer, you specify what outcomes you want to achieve for your design and how they are measured. With your guidance, the computer produces sets of optimal designs, along with the data to prove which design performs best against your goals. Analyzing how the generated designs measure up against the set goals, you can gain valuable insight into which design aspects impact the outcome & how.

## Faster

Generative design can help you find better designs for your project faster, by leveraging what machines are good at: computation & repetition. Computers can generate and evaluate a huge number of design variants in only a fraction of the time it would take an individual designer, allowing you to learn what works & what doesn't at an accelerated pace.

## More variation

Your initial design parameters are used to generate many, even thousands, of potential design solutions, with the only limitation being how much compute power and time you have.

For example, it's feasible for you to explore ten variants or a few tens if using established computational design techniques. It is not uncommon however for an algorithm, once created, to generate thousands of variants in mere minutes.

## Collaborative

The aim of a generative approach is to **augment human capability** with computation power, not to replace designers.

To help illustrate this, remember that a good generative design process that uses several metrics to analyze designs in a study will rarely generate a single output. It  will almost always generate a wide range of outputs from which the designer can choose. That is, it doesn’t choose for you, it provides a list of options to choose from, and the options have already been objectively assessed and ranked.
