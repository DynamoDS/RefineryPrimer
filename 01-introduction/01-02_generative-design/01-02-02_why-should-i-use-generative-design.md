# Why Should I Use Generative Design?

In a nutshell, generative design is a goal-driven approach to design that uses automation so that designers and engineers can:

* have better insight into their designs;
* make faster and more informed design decisions; and
* explore more options using the power of computers.

## Better Outcomes and Insight

As the designer, you specify which outcomes you want to achieve for your design and how they are measured. With your guidance, the computer produces sets of optimal designs, along with the data to prove which design performs best against your goals. By analyzing how the generated designs measure up against the set goals, you can gain valuable insight into which design aspects impact the outcome and how.

## Faster, More Informed Design Decisions

Generative design can help you find better designs for your project more quickly by leveraging what computers are good at: computation and repetition. 

Computers can generate and evaluate a huge number of design variants in only a fraction of the time it would take an individual designer, allowing you to learn what does and doesn't work at an accelerated pace.

## A Greater Variety of Options

Your initial design parameters are used to generate many, even thousands, of potential design solutions, with the only limitation being how much computer power and time you have.

For example, it's feasible for you to explore ten variants \(or even a few tens\) when using established computational design techniques. However, once created, an algorithm can generate thousands of variants in mere minutes.

## A Collaborative Approach

The aim of a generative approach is not to replace designers - it is to augment human capability with computation power.

To illustrate this, remember that a good generative design process using several metrics to analyze designs in a study will rarely generate a single output. Instead, it will almost always generate a range of outputs that the designer can choose from, all of which will already have been objectively assessed and ranked. It doesn't choose for you.
