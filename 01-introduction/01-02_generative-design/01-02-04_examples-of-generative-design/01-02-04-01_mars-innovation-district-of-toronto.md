# MaRs Innovation District of Toronto

To design the new office and research space in the MaRs Innovation District of Toronto, Autodesk used generative design processes. 

Starting with high-level goals and constraints, the design team used the power of computation to generate, evaluate and evolve thousands of design alternatives. The result was a high-performing and novel work environment that would not have been possible without this approach.

## Generate

The designers created a geometric system that meant the computer could explore multiple configurations of work neighborhoods, amenity spaces and circulation zones. This work represents the _`define`_ step of the _`generate`_ phase.

Using this algorithm, the computer varied the parameters to produce thousands of design options.

## Evaluate

For this stage, information was collected from employees and managers about work styles and location preferences. Based on this data, six primary and measurable goals were defined:

* work style preference
* adjacency preference
* low distraction
* interconnectivity
* daylight
* views to the outside

The designers then created an algorithm to measure how any given floor plan could be measured against each of the goals above. Known as _`evaluators`_, these algorithms represent the _`analyse`_ and _`rank`_ stages of the generative process.

After the algorithms were formulated, the computer used them to evaluate each of the designs generated in the previous stage against the defined goals.

## Explore

After the designs were evaluated, the designers looked at the _`solution space`_ to explore the generated designs together with their evaluation results. 

Taking into account each defined goal, they identified the design that best achieved the goals overall.
